Run main.py in a 210 x 35 pixel cosole. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. Ill gladly explain my code to anyone.

You should focus on how I handle the screen function. If you have any issues running the game let me know. I've only ever tried it on my computer, so it could possibly do different things on other computers. But overall I highly reccomend this game very fun. Easy to play. PEFECT for F1 FANS

You can watch DEMO.mp4 for a run through of the game.


Each "Scene" is located in the Scenes folder.
