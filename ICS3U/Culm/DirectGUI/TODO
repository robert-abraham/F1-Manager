TODO:

Small features:
look for custom installed widgets in the default python pip install folder created for custom widgets if exist
-> All custom widgets that can be installed via pip should add their .widget files there.

Mixed size features:
add further missing features to properties editor:
-> Values for multiple states
-> Geom property
-> Make sure base gui item properties are available/enabled broadly
--> Make properties that are defined in base (text, geom, image) available for all by default if the values are given (like text for frames)
-> Missing properties for button, entries and text
--> Missing text align for frames if they have text
-> Make text entry for texts multiline
-> Add None frame type
-> Make Scrollbar Properties available for scrolled frames

Larger features:
add multi-select functionality
add undo/redo (kill-ring like in emacs?) functionality
editor tabs to edit multiple GUIs at once
add project file
-> Store specific settings
    -> Store workspace path
    -> Store asset path
    -> Store custom widget path
-> Store opened GUIs

Custom Widgets related:
